This is the second project I did for the Campus 19 Common Core (part of the international 42 Network). Printf is one of the most fundamental functions a C programmer uses. In this project, we make our own printf, learning about variadic functions and well structured code in the process.

Allowed functions: free, malloc, write, va_arg, va_start, va_copy, va_end.

Score: 100/100
